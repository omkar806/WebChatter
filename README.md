**WebChatter**: An intelligent web interaction tool that harnesses the power of RAG (Retriever, Aggregator, Generator) flow to facilitate seamless communication with websites. Upon receiving a webpage link, WebChatter swiftly scrapes the webpage, extracts its textual content, and divides it into manageable chunks. These chunks are then embedded with metadata and stored in a Pinecone vector database.

Once the index is established, users can engage in conversational queries. By inputting a query, WebChatter generates embeddings for the query and calculates cosine similarity scores between these embeddings and the embeddings of the webpage chunks. The chunks exhibiting the highest similarity scores are selected and passed to the Language Model (LLM) along with the query, facilitating accurate and targeted responses.
